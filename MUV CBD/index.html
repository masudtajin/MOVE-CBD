                    <span>Dear valued customers,</span>
                    <p>You may have heard that MÜV Medical Cannabis and MÜV CBD have joined forces with Verano earlier this year. As part of this combination, we have decided to refocus on the continued growth and innovation of cannabis-based wellness and will no longer be offering our MÜV CBD brand of products. We apologize to those who </p>
                    
                    <p>We thank you for your support and hope you will in some capacity continue your journey with us along this path of growth and evolution as we navigate an ever-changing cannabis landscape.</p>

                    <p>
                    If you have any questions regarding this change, about finding a dispensary near you, or whether you’re eligible for cannabis-derived CBD through your state’s medical marijuana program, please contact Verano Customer Care at 833-880-5420</p>
